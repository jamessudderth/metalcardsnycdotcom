 have an admin dashboard already built. I need you to go through the entire codebase line by line and ensure there are no errors, typos, missing dependencies, or dead links anywhere.

Then, confirm and implement the following so that every feature is fully functional and properly connected to my systems:

✅ Complete order management system with stats cards
– Display total orders, pending orders, completed orders, and revenue.
– Pull this live data directly from my connected Shopify account.

✅ Real‑time order tracking and search functionality
– Ensure orders update live as statuses change in Shopify.
– Search bar must return matching orders instantly.

✅ Business card generation monitoring
– Tie the dashboard into the custom business card generation system I built.
– Make sure I can see status of generated cards and download them from the dashboard.

✅ System health status monitoring
– Verify the system health panel works and displays accurate backend status (server uptime, script errors, queue backlogs, etc.).

✅ Customer details with contact information
– Show customer info (name, email, phone) for each order, pulled live from Shopify.

✅ Order status tracking (pending, processing, completed)
– Ensure status updates flow through from Shopify and reflect instantly on the dashboard.

✅ Revenue analytics and order statistics
– Make sure revenue stats are calculated correctly from Shopify order data.
– Display graphs/charts if possible.

✅ Integration checks
– Confirm the dashboard is connected to:
• My Shopify account (via API)
• My business card generation system
• The Playwright script I uploaded (ensure it can run and report results into the dashboard)

✅ Full code audit
– Go through all code files line by line to catch any mistakes, dead links, or unused imports.
– Run tests to confirm all buttons, tabs, and features work.

✅ Profile integration
– Ensure I can access all admin features by clicking the “Admin Dashboard” tab in my profile.

When finished, run the code, simulate a few orders through Shopify, and show me screenshots or console logs proving:
– Orders are fetched and statuses update in real time
– Searching for an order returns correct results
– Download buttons for business cards work
– System health panel reports correctly
– Revenue analytics populate correctly.

Important: Give me a summary report of what you checked, what you fixed, and what’s still pending, if anything.

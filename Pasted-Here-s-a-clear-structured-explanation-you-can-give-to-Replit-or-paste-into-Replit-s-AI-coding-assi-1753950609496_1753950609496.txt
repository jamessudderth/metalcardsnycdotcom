Here‚Äôs a clear, structured explanation you can give to Replit (or paste into Replit‚Äôs AI coding assistant or support), telling it exactly what the system should be doing ‚Äî based on everything you‚Äôve built and previously discussed:

üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements for Business Card Generator

Objective:
Replit needs to ensure that the following full flow is working seamlessly:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Customer Flow:
	1.	Template Selection
When a customer visits the site, they should be able to:
	‚Ä¢	View all available business card templates.
	‚Ä¢	Click on a template to select it.
	2.	Form Entry + Live Preview
After selecting a template:
	‚Ä¢	Customer fills in their personal details (name, title, phone, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Their info should be injected dynamically into the selected SVG template.
	‚Ä¢	A live preview of the card with their information should be shown.
	3.	QR Code Generation
	‚Ä¢	Simultaneously, a QR code should be generated that links to the customer‚Äôs digital profile (a unique URL on the site).
	‚Ä¢	This QR code should be placed on the back of the business card.

‚∏ª

üñ•Ô∏è Admin Flow (My Dashboard):
	4.	Submission & Save
	‚Ä¢	Once the customer confirms:
	‚Ä¢	Both front (with info) and back (with QR) SVGs or PNGs should be saved.
	‚Ä¢	These versions should be sent to the admin dashboard.
	5.	Admin Preview + Download
	‚Ä¢	On the admin side, I need to:
	‚Ä¢	See both the front and back of the finalized card.
	‚Ä¢	Be able to download those files directly (SVG or PNG) for production.

‚∏ª

üß† Tech Functionality Summary:
	‚Ä¢	Inject customer data into correct SVG template.
	‚Ä¢	Use uploaded SVGs from /public/templates/business-card-temp/{templateName}.svg
	‚Ä¢	Ensure SVG text layers are editable/dynamic via JS/React (i.e. use <text id="name"> etc. to map inputs).
	‚Ä¢	Generate and insert QR code (can use libraries like qrcode.react).
	‚Ä¢	Display a preview of both sides.
	‚Ä¢	Send finished card assets to admin dashboard (can be handled via Firebase, Supabase, or serverless DB).
	‚Ä¢	Enable download buttons on admin dashboard.

‚∏ª

üìå What to Fix (copy this if needed):

Replit isn‚Äôt currently:
	‚Ä¢	Injecting the customer‚Äôs information into the chosen SVG template
	‚Ä¢	Generating a preview with that live data
	‚Ä¢	Creating and attaching the QR code to the back
	‚Ä¢	Sending the finalized card to my admin dashboard with both front and back images for download

Please review the logic and file linking between:
	‚Ä¢	Form input ‚Üí template population
	‚Ä¢	QR code generation
	‚Ä¢	Image export ‚Üí admin dashboard preview/download

If you‚Äôd like, I can help you create a checklist or code template for each part (SVG injection, QR code logic, admin transfer). Just say the word.
